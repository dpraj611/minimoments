# 🌟 Mini Moments Nursery Website

The official website for **Mini Moments Nursery**.  
Live at 👉 [minimomentsnursery.com](https://minimomentsnursery.com)
This isn’t just a nursery website — it’s a little digital home where smiles, giggles, and mindful growth live. Built with love (and probably too much coffee), so parents can trust it as much as their kids love it.

Built with love, caffeine, and way too many prompts.  
Originally launched through Bolt, now running smoothly on Netlify—because even nursery websites outgrow their baby steps.  
Fast, responsive, and cuter than your average nursery site.
